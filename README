For setting up a project environment observe the following:

- I'm developing on a Mac, but the system stack is available on all three major platforms (Win/Mac/Linux).

- I use Eclipse, and a project file is included.

- System runs with apache web server.  Ideally the server should provide access to the site root folder 
	and deny web access to the includes and pages directories.  .htaccess files have been provided as such,
	however ideally this should be set by the server and not .htaccess.  To use .htaccess files, add the "AllowOverride None"
	option in the site's "Directory" directive in httpd.conf/user.conf/site.conf (located in /etc/apache2 in 
	Mac/UNIX, and in C:\System*\etc\apache2 in Windows systems if I remember correctly).
	
	Needless to say, PHP should be installed and the apache php module should be loaded (httpd.conf); this is usually 
	trivial.
	
	Additionally, the PostgreSQL php drivers should be installed.
	
	Mac has built in support for both Apache and PHP.
	
	Otherwise you need to install Apache and PHP + drivers as indicated for your OS in their respective websites.
	
- PostgreSQL is the backend for now; you should be able to log in as the pgsql sysadmin.  Databse setup files are 
	in Installation folder.  
	
	1. You should create a file called loadSampleData.psql with (at least) the single SQL statement: 
		INSERT INTO users (email, role) VALUES ('your_email_address_here@gmail.com', 0);
	to add yourself as a LogApp admin user authorized to view all pages.    
	
	2. Make sure you setup the variables in the setVars.psql and includes/LogApp.php files to match.
	3. Run the file DatabaseSetup.psql as the PostgreSQL admin to setup the database.
	
- The google php api client: https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/php/start/installation.  After installing
	on server, set path in includes/LogApp.php	
  
- The client secret needs to be in the includes directory. You should contact a developer to get a hold of the 
	client secret to authenticate.  The secret file name can be set in includes/LogApp.php

- General way to make a new page is:
	1. Create the new file under the pages directory.
	2. Create a new case statement on the switch/case statement in default.php. (script in html head)
	3. Under the case statement, set the $headerText and $articleSource variables
	4. Create a list item and link/anchor directly in html in the <nav> element for regular user item, or
		in php (for admin items) in the head script to link to the new file.
		
This is a work in progress.
